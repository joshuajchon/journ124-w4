I chose the question "Is it rude to move to an unsold seat on a plane?" since it highlights a common social dilemma with no clear etiquette rules. I was curious to see how public opinion varies on something that often happens in everyday travel but isn't regurlarly addressed.

Something about the data that I found interesting was that a large majority of respondents (80%) felt it was not rude at all to switch to an unsold seat which shows a general acceptance of this behavior. A small minority found it somewhat or very rude, suggesting that some people still value sticking to assigned seating regardless of availability.

The chart was able to help visualize how the 855 respondants answered the etiquette question and what the majority of people thought. It was clear through the bar chart that "No, not rude at all" was the dominant opinion. This visualization makes the distribution of sentiment easy to grasp at a glance.
